Colours used for what the app could be

Don't forget to check what credentials will be used in the login system, usernames might not be needed for example


User/Customer ID will have to be changed to integer whenever used globally

Check what database you're connected too, ESPECIALLY if you're using Bean and brew code, most table names will be same so might try looking for column that doesn't exist in a table that does but isn't relevant



Parse SQL statements wherever you can, example for outputting name into a text box being parsed seen below
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |
                                        \/

string userNameFind = "SELECT firstName, lastName FROM customers WHERE customerID = @customerId";
            MySqlCommand cmd = new MySqlCommand(userNameFind, conn);
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@customerId", int.Parse(customerID));
            MySqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
            if (rdr.Read())
            {
                txtBlockWelcome.Text = $"Hello {rdr.GetString(0)} {rdr.GetString(1)}";
            }
            conn.Close();
